<h1 align=center>About Me</h1>
My name is Kvothe. I consider myself sharp-tounged and wit, but I also consider myself as a fool in rare occasions. I have pale skin and green eyes, however people say that my eyes change color according my mood and atmosphere. I have extremeley red hair often compared to a flame.
<br>
<br>
I am of the Edma-Ruh, which means I travel a lot, never settling at one location. I love to perform and play the lute. I could not get enough of the lute, it is part of me and as a musician would know, is also the most important object i own. The first lute I've owned was broken by a bully like kid in Tarbean. Later I have acquired a new lute during my time at the University. However it was also broken by a man named Ambrose, which then bought me a new lute after a trial at the University. How else a musician would react with nothing in the world beside his instrument broken.
<br>
I am the lead character in a book series called "The Kingkiller Chronicle".

Although I prefer Thomas Bergerse, the creator of this site insisted to add a playlist of his favorite album: Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest.

<b><u>Explain the differences using an example of a use case:</b></u>
<br>
Say a user wants to look for information regarding side effects of drug X and is also interested in other drugs with the same side effects.
<br>
In web1.0 the user would have to go to a specific site that contains such information. The user must know the site in advance and its credibility. 
<br>
However in web3.0, the internet is indexed and parsed constantly, making searching easier using semantics search, relevance and scoring. <br>
Say the user searches on Google "What are the side effects of drug X", the user will get as a result many websites that are likely more credible thanks to advanced ranking algorithms.
<br>
Let's say as a part of the use case: that the user is also interested in other drugs that cause the same side effects as drug X. 
Because web3.0 sites allow various ways to collect data, some sites offer suggestions to other pages related to the pages users have visited in the past.
Thanks to that, the same site that user has selected on his first search, shows at the end of the page a link that suggests the user to "View other drugs with the same side effects".
<br>
These kind of suggestions to users are based on various data collected from the site in and are possible thanks to Web3.0.
